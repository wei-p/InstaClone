Maintainer guidelines
=====================

Hello, and thank you for choosing to contribute to this repository. The short
information below will help everyone to stop calling me a fascist:

1. Always test your changes and write tests for them. The tests run
   automatically and will tell you if there's a problem on any of the
   supported platforms/versions.
2. When committing, categorize what you did by following [Angular's Git Commit
   Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).
   Basically, prepend one of feat/fix/docs/style/refactor/perf/text/chore to the
   commit subject, like so: `fix: Fix foo in bar.`. Capitalizing the first
   letter and trailing periods are encouraged.
3. Don't be an asshole.

That's pretty much it, thanks for your contribution!
